      <h1>EXERCISE SCIENCE TO A CAREER IN DATA</h1>
      <h2>Why I transitioned careers</h2>
      <p>
        In August 2022, I transitioned to a Data Engineer position from my role
        working as a Sport Scientist and Associate Researcher. I thoroughly
        enjoyed my previous role and it was difficult leaving the position and
        everyone I worked with, but I did it primarily for career prospects...

      <h2>What is each field?</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Summary and basic statistics</li>
        <li>Cleaning data</li>
        <li>SQL – Structured Query Language</li>
        <li>Python and/or R</li>
        <li>Data visualization – Tableau and/or PowerBi</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
      <p>
        Data Scientists build on the skills of a Data Analyst and go deeper into
        programming and advanced statistics...
      </p>

      <h3>Data Engineer</h3>
      <p>
        Data Engineers build the infrastructure for Data Analysts and Data
        Scientists to do their job...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>SQL, Python, maybe R</li>
        <li>
          Cloud Computing – Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google
          Cloud
        </li>
        <li>Extract Transform Load (ETL) experience</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How I transitioned</h2>
      <h3>Self-Study</h3>
      <p>
        This Coursera article outlines the responsibilities, tools, and
        opportunities in data analytics. I have mentioned Coursera several
        times, however I personally do not use it much. I believe it can be good
        for a general overview of a topic but I don’t believe you will truly
        learn a topic on Coursera as the 5-15 minute lectures don’t thoroughly
        explain the topic at hand...

      </ul>

      <h3>Personal Portfolio</h3>
      <p>
        I began my personal portfolio and am working on expanding it with
        additional projects. Unless you get an additional degree, I think a
        portfolio is the way to go as it showcases your skill set. Degrees and
        certifications are nice, but what can you do? Projects showcase that.
      </p>

      <h3>Resume</h3>
      <p>
        I reworked my resume to mention my skills Python, Tableau, SQL, and R on
        top of my resume and education on the bottom. Did this help? I’m not
        entirely certain, but it may have helped and didn’t hurt.
      </p>

      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>
        My aim is to flourish as a Data Engineer and do my best to build this
        skill set. It’s still early in my career, so I’m going to see what’s
        demanded from me and then emphasize on how I can better contribute. It’s
        going to be a slow roll but we’ll see where things go.
